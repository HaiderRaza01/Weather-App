# Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring

This repository contains a **Real-Time Data Processing System** designed for weather monitoring, implementing rollups and aggregates to provide insightful and timely weather data. The system ingests real-time data, processes it, and generates aggregated metrics for improved analysis and decision-making.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Collects data from multiple weather sensors.
- **Data Processing**: Processes incoming data to handle rollups and aggregates.
- **Aggregated Metrics**: Generates useful metrics such as average temperature, humidity levels, and wind speed.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Triggers alerts based on predefined weather conditions.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Visualizes processed data for easy analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and aggregation.
- **SQLite**: For collecting the data in the database.
